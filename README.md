## Domain Info Goodness

Ever need to split up a url to get some info? Say the subdomain, or the top level domain or what have you or what not? I did, so I tossed this module together.

[See a demo](http://benrlodge.github.io/domain-info/)

It's as simple as...

```javascript

Domain.url();

Domain.protocol();

Domain.and-so-on-and-so-forth

```
